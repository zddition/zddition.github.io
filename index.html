    <p>Hey there! I'm a mechanical engineer with a passion for design, manufacturing, experiments, and learning new things! I wanted to create a place where I could share some of the interesting things I've been making and exploring. So here we are! I hope you enjoy! Is that too many exclamation points? Never!!  </p>
