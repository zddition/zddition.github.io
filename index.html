    <h1>Zddition</h1>
    <p>Hey there! I'm a mechanical engineer with a passion for design, manufacturing, experiments, and learning new things! I like to approach everything new with the same mindset: "How hard could that be?" Turns out, most things are pretty simple (not easy) when you break them down. I wanted to create a place where I could share some of the interesting things I've been making and exploring as well as the resources and inspirations that helped me along the way. So here we are! I hope you enjoy! </p>
